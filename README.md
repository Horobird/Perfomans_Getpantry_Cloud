Here is one example of load testing with the help of tools from Artillery.      
The Pantry resource is selected as the test object. With the help of Artillery, users are created who, through the API, change information in the authorized pantry.     
Artillery manipulates the time and number of users, increasing or decreasing the load on the server. The test report is displayed in the terminal B and can also be      
received in the form of json or HTML.
